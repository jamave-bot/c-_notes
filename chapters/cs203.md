# CS 203

When we code there are 3 places our code is stored:

**Code**

The instructions of the program

**Stack**

Where our function calls/temporary data is stored

**Heap**

The heap is where data is stored permanently. It's up to us to delete this data. 


```
in linux, some useful commands to navigate terminal:

pwd: (print working directory) shows current location 
ls: (list) shows what's in current folder
cd: (change directory) changes directory to a directory inside current location
    without argument, goes to home directory
    .. :goes back to parent directory

```

## Steps to coding in C++

Editing -> Preprocessing -> Compilation (Object code) -> Linking process -> Loading -> Execution


**Preprocessing** -> e.g. #includes which tells us what libraries we're going to be using

We will be combining preprocessing and compilation to 1 step and we'll be combining the last 3 to 1 step


## sample c++

```cpp
int main() {
    int x; // declaration
    int y,z; // declares y and z
    int t=42; // declaration and initialization
    string msg="Hello"; // declaration and initialization
    x=10;
    y=x+t; // 52
    z=y; // 52
    y=y*2; //104
    msg = msg + "; y="; // "Hello; y="
    cout << msg << y << "; z=" << z << endl; 
    return 0;
}
```


1 byte = 8 bits
int uses 4 bytes, so 32 bits

in 32 bits, the first is the **signed bit**, 

if it's **0(unsigned)**, the number will be **positive**, 

if **1(signed)**, the number will be **negative** 

since we only have 31 bits, the largest int we can hold is 2<sup>31</sup>

any type declaration/initialization that has **unsigned** will be positive no matter what.
