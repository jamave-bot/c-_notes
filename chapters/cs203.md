***Date**: 1/25/24*

When we code there are 3 places our code is stored:

**Code**

The instructions of the program

**Stack**

Where our function calls/temporary data is stored

**Heap**

The heap is where data is stored permanently. It's up to us to delete this data. 


```
in linux, some useful commands to navigate terminal:

pwd: (print working directory) shows current location 
ls: (list) shows what's in current folder
cd: (change directory) changes directory to a directory inside current location
    without argument, goes to home directory
    .. :goes back to parent directory

```

## Steps to coding in C++

Editing -> Preprocessing -> Compilation (Object code) -> Linking process -> Loading -> Execution


**Preprocessing** -> e.g. #includes which tells us what libraries we're going to be using

We will be combining preprocessing and compilation to 1 step and we'll be combining the last 3 to 1 step


## sample c++

```cpp
int main() {
    int x; // declaration
    int y,z; // declares y and z
    int t=42; // declaration and initialization
    string msg="Hello"; // declaration and initialization
    x=10;
    y=x+t; // 52
    z=y; // 52
    y=y*2; //104
    msg = msg + "; y="; // "Hello; y="
    cout << msg << y << "; z=" << z << endl; 
    return 0;
}
```


1 byte = 8 bits
int uses 4 bytes, so 32 bits

in 32 bits, the first is the **signed bit**, 

if it's **0(unsigned)**, the number will be **positive**, 

if **1(signed)**, the number will be **negative** 

since we only have 31 bits, the largest int we can hold is 2<sup>31</sup>

any type declaration/initialization that has **unsigned** will be positive no matter what.

## Going over comparison operators

- different data types will not give a true boolean value despite having the same value 
    - e.g. 
    
    ```cpp
    float x = 0.1; 
    double y = 0.1; 
    cout << x == y  //would return false (0);
    ```

in order to see 'true' or 'false' we have to add the 'bool alpha' statement to the cout
    
e.g.
```cpp
cout << bool alpha << (a == b); // would show 'true' or 'false'
```

**Negation** has precedence over conjuntion and disjunction

- anything other than 0 in C++ is evaluated as true

**Conjunction** has precedence over disjunction


**&& and || are short circuit (aka lazy) operators.**

- When evaluating a&&b, if a is false, b is not evaluated
- when evaluating a||b, if a is true, b is not evaluated 

## The string type

- String is not primitice and requires the inclusino of the string library 
 ```cpp
 #include <string>
 ```

 Some escaped sequences include 
 
- \n newline
- \r returns the cursor to the front 


**cin** only records one line, to read the entire input we have to use **getline**

e.g. 
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main (){
    string s;

    cout << "Enter a string: ";
    // cin >> s; this would only record 1 word
    getline(cin, s);

    cout << s << endl; // would return the entire line inputted

    return 0;
}
```

- the 1st argument in getline is the istream object from which characters are extracted 
- the 2nd argument is where the input is stored

## Flow control

- if/else
- switch

e.g.
```cpp
switch (value to be checked){
    case value:
        instructions
        break;
    case value:
        instructions
        break;
    case value:
        instructions
        break;
    default: 
        instructions
        break;
}
```

### for loops

syntax: 
```cpp
for (initialization; test; action){
    loop content;
}
```
<br>
e.g. decrementing for loop

```cpp
int main(){
    for(int i = 100; i >= 1; i--){
        cout << i << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### while loops

syntax:
```cpp
while(condition){
    loop content;
}
```

e.g. while loop with input
```cpp
string user_input;
cout << "Hi, input line: ";
while (getline(cin, user_input)){ 
    // this will continue as long as user doesn't input the 'end input' command
    cout << "Tell me more...";
} // to exit this in linux, user can enter ctrl+D

cout << "thanks for ending it all!";
```

## Functions

syntax: 
```cpp
return_type function_name (type_of_arg1 name_of_arg1 type_of_arg2 name_of_arg2...){
    //code
}
```

e.g.
```cpp
float volumeCylinder (float radius, float height){
    return radius * radius * 3.14 * height;
}

int main(void){
    cout << volumeCylinder(4,6) << endl;
}
```

## the void type

- A type that isn't one
- the type of nothingness
- Sometimes also used to mean 'unknown'

## Arrays 

- An array is a contiguous group of memory locations that all have the same type.
- To refer to a particular location or element in the array, specify the name of the array and the position number of the particular element.
- The position number is more formally called a subscript or index (this number specifies the number of elements from the beginning of the array).
- The first element in every array has subscript 0 (zero) and is sometimes called the zeroth element.


```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <array>

using namespace std;

int main(){
    array<int, 10> myintarray; // initialize an array of 10 int elements called myintarray

    // To display the elements in the array
    for (int i = 0; i < myintarray.size(); i++){ //size() function returns the initalized size of the array
        myintarray[i] = i+1; //stores the value of i in the corresponding index - 1
    }

    for (int element: myintarray){ // for every integer element in myintarray
        cout << element << " ";
    }

    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Classes 

```cpp
// Account.h

#ifndef ACCOUNT_H //if this is not defined, we define it here, this prevents error of multiple includes of this file in other files
#define ACCOUNT_H 

#include <string>
#include <iostream>

class Account{
public:
    Account(){}

    explicit Account(std::string accountName):name(accountName){} //if only 1 argument we can put the word 'explicit' before the function name

    Account(std::string accountName, int initialBalance) 
        :name(accountName){

        if (initialBalance > 0){
            balance = initialBalance;
        }
    }

    void deposit(int depositAmount){
        if (depositAmount > 0){
            balance = balance + depositAmount;
        }
    }

    int getBalance() const{
        return balance;
    }

    void setName(std::string accountName){
        name = accountName;
    }

    std::string getName() const{ // const keyword after to ensure no data is being changed
        return name;
    }

    void withdraw(int withdrawAmount){
        if (withdrawAmount <= balance){
            balance = balance - withdrawAmount;
        } else{
            std::cout << "Withdrawal amount exceeded account balance";
        }
    }

private:
    std::string name; // default constructor called here 
    int balance{0};
};

#endif //ends the define
```
